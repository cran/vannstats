#' Fording's State Ideology Data
#'
#' This data set comes from Richard C. Fording (\url{https://rcfording.com/state-ideology-data/}) and used in Berry et al. (1998). The data set includes state ideology data (measured at the state/legislature and citizen levels), for each year between 1960 and 2018. These data will be updated as Fording updates the data.
